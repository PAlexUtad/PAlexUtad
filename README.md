## 🧠 Background

Before diving into game development, I studied **Physics at EPFL** in Switzerland, where I completed a master’s degree and contributed to research on quantum magnetism. I co-authored various scientific papers, such as [*Revisiting the magnetic and crystal structure of multiferroic KNiPO₄*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06969).

After graduating, I worked as an IT consultant in private banking, where I helped bridge technical and business needs.

Currently, I’m studying **game programming at U-TAD in Madrid**, learning advanced C++ and Unreal Engine systems while immersing myself in Spanish and collaborative game dev culture.

I’m entirely **self-taught in 3D modeling, texturing, VFX, and digital art**. Whether it’s building gameplay prototypes or stylizing a character rig, I love crafting every layer of a game from scratch.
